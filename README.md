# _[SDL Seminar](https://github.com/tlively/sdl_seminar)_ Implemented In Go

Content is from the seminar [Writing 2D Games in C using SDL by Thomas Lively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFLa3ln16w0). The original source was [written in C](https://github.com/tlively/sdl_seminar).

As a way for me to learn both Go and SDL, this is my attempt at porting the tutorial source to Go.
